<h2>Get your best ideas into development.</h2>
<p>Whether you use Waterfall, Agile, or Conversational Development, GitLab streamlines your collaborative workflows. Visualize, prioritize, coordinate, and track your progress your way with GitLab’s flexible project management tools.</p>

<p>Create
<h2>Securely write and manage code and project data.</h2>
Consolidate source code into a single DVCS that’s easily managed and controlled without disrupting your workflow. GitLab’s git repositories come complete with branching tools and access controls, providing a scalable, single source of truth for collaborating on projects and code.

<p>Verify
<h2>Ship better software, faster.</h2>
Spot errors sooner, improve security and shorten feedback cycles with built-in static code analysis, code testing, code quality, dependency checking and review apps. Customize your approval workflow controls, automatically test the quality of your code, and spin up a staging environment for every code change. GitLab Continuous Integration is the most popular next generation testing system that scales to run your tests faster.

<p>Package
<h2>Manage custom container images with ease.</h2>
GitLab Container Registry gives you the enhanced security and access controls of custom Docker images without 3rd party add-ons. Easily upload and download images from GitLab CI with full Git repository management integration.

<p>Release</p>
<h2>Minimize complexity with built-in Continuous Delivery.</h2>
Spend less time configuring your tools, and more time creating. Whether you’re deploying to one server or thousands, build, test, and release your code confidently and securely with GitLab’s built-in continuous delivery and deployment.

<p>Configure</p>
<h2>Automate configuration management</h2>
Automate your entire workflow from build to deploy and monitoring with GitLab Auto Devops. Best practice templates get you started with minimal to zero configuration. Then customize everything from buildpacks to CI/CD.

<p>Monitor</p>
<h2>Monitor and manage application performance.</h2>
Ensure your applications are always responsive and available. GitLab collects and displays performance metrics for deployed apps using Prometheus so you can know in an instant how code changes impact your production environment.

		<p>Integrated teams working together

		GitLab is the first single application built from the ground up for all stages of the DevOps lifecycle for Product, Development, QA, Security, and Operations teams to work concurrently on the same project. GitLab enables teams to collaborate and work from a single conversation, instead of managing multiple threads across disparate tools. GitLab provides teams a single data store, one user interface, and one permission model across the DevOps lifecycle allowing teams to collaborate, significantly reducing cycle time and focus exclusively on building great software quickly.</p>

		<p>GitLab + Google Cloud Platform = simplified, scalable deployment

		GitLab’s native Google Kubernetes Engine integration increases developer productivity. With Auto DevOps, GitLab automatically configures CI/CD pipelines to build, test, verify, and deploy applications to Google Cloud Platform.</p>

			<p>Work Concurrently, No More Handoffs
			Dev, QA, Security and Operations are part of a single conversation throughout the lifecycle. Detect problems earlier by ‘shifting them to the left’ and solving them with out delays.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			Teams work at the same time instead of waiting for Security, QA, and Operations handoffs because teams are backlogged.
